<p class="c"><i>A plan of the stage of the New Theatre, London, set for the play is
given at the end of the book.{<a href="#SCENE_PLOT">*</a>}</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The Hall of Mulberry Manor. All the furniture looks very
comfortable. Through the window can be seen a glimpse of a snowy
garden; there is a log fire. The light is a little dim, being late
afternoon. Seated on the table swinging her legs is</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span>, <i>she is
attired in a fur coat and goloshes, very little else can be seen,
except a pink healthy looking young face.</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>is seated on the
Chesterfield</i> <span class="smcap">R</span>. <i>She is twenty-one and exceedingly pretty. It is
about five days before Christmas.</i> </p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>brightly</i>). My feet are simply soaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>sewing</i>). Why on earth don't you go and change them? You'll
catch cold.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>enters</i> <span class="smcap">R</span>. <i>He is a slim, bright-looking youth of twenty.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> I don't mind if I do. (<i>Laughs.</i>) Colds are fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> She loves having a fuss made of her, beef tea&mdash;chicken&mdash;jelly
with whipped cream&mdash;and fires in her bedroom, little Sybarite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> So do you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C</span>.). No, I don't; whenever my various ailments confine
me to my bed, I chafe&mdash;positively chafe at the terrible inactivity. I
want to be up and about, shooting, riding, cricket, football, judo, the
usual run of manly sports.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Knowing you for what you are&mdash;lazy, luxurious&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>pained</i>). Please, please, please, not in front of the child.
(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>kicks</i>). It's demoralizing for her to hear her idolized brother
held up to ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> You're not my idolized brother at all&mdash;Oliver is. (<i>Turning away,
pouting.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>seated</i> <span class="smcap">R</span>. <i>on Chesterfield, sweetly</i>). If that were really so,
dear, I know you have much too kind a heart to let me know it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> What is the matter with you this afternoon, Bobbie&mdash;you are very
up in the air about something.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>takes her coat off, puts on back of chair</i> <span class="smcap">R</span>. <i>of table</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>rising and sitting on club fender</i>). Merely another instance of
the triumph of mind over matter; in this case a long and healthy walk
was the matter. I went into the lobby to put on my snow boots and
then&mdash;as is usually the case with me&mdash;my mind won. I thought of tea,
crumpets and comfort. Oliver has gone without me, he simply bursts with
health and extraordinary dullness. Personally I shall continue to be
delicate and interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>seriously</i>). You may <i>have</i> to work, Bobbie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Really, Sylvia, you do say the most awful things, remember Joyce
is only a school-girl, she'll be quite shocked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> We work jolly hard at school, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Oh, no, you don't. I've read the modern novelists, and I <i>know</i>;
all you do is walk about with arms entwined, and write poems of tigerish
adoration to your mistresses. It's a beautiful existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> You are a silly ass. (<i>Picks up magazine.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> It's all very well to go on fooling Bobbie, but <i>really</i> we
shall have to pull ourselves together a bit. Mother's very worried, as
you know, money troubles are perfectly beastly, and she hasn't told us
nearly all. I do so hate her to be upset, poor darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> What can we do? (<i>Sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>end of Chesterfield.</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>puts
down magazine and listens.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Think of a way to make money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> It's difficult now that the war is over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> That's cheap wit, dear; also it's the wrong moment for it.
(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>giggles.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> It's always the wrong moment for cheap wit, admitting for one
moment that it was, which it wasn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Oh, do shut up, you make my head go round.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>downstairs; she is tall and almost beautiful;<br />
she carries a book in her hand.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>turning</i>). Oh, Vangy, do come and join us; we're on the verge
of a congress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> I must read some more Maeterlinck. (<i>Posing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> You mean you must let us see you reading Maeterlinck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>goes to him, back of Chesterfield, touches his hair.</i>) Try
not to be so irritating, Bobbie dear; just because you don't happen to
appreciate good literature, it's very small and narrow to laugh at
people who do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> But seriously, Vangy, we are rather worried (<span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>moves</i>)
about mother; she's been looking harassed for days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>sitting in armchair</i>). What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Money, money, money! Haven't you realized that! Uncle Daniel
sent a pretty substantial cheque from South America (<i>all nod</i>) that
helped things on a bit after Father's death, but that must be gone by
now&mdash;and mother won't say how much father left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Perhaps she doesn't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> She must know now, he's been dead nearly six
months&mdash;inconsiderate old beast!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Bobbie, you're not to talk about father like that. I won't have
it; after all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> After all what?&mdash;He was perfectly rotten to mother, and never
came near her for four years before his death. Why should we be charming
and reverent about him just because he's our father. When I saw him I
hated him, and his treatment of mum hasn't made me like him any better,
I can tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> But still, Bobbie, he was <i>our father</i>, and mother was fond
of him&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Ha!)&mdash;once, anyhow there's nothing to be gained by
running him down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> The point is, have we enough money to keep on as we are, or
haven't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>quickly</i>). The only one who knows is mother, and she won't say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> We haven't asked her yet; we'll make her say. Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Up in her room, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Go and fetch her down. (<i>Puts sewing on form.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> What, now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Yes, <i>now</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia and Evangeline.</span> Yes, go along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Righto! we'll tackle her straight away.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>upstairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>). Do&mdash;do you think we may have to leave this
house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> I should simply hate that. (<i>Sits on right end of form.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> So should we all&mdash;it would be miserable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Think how awful it must be for mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> I say, don't you think Oliver ought to be here&mdash;if anything's
going to happen? He's the eldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> He wouldn't be any help. He cares for nothing but the inside of
motors and the outside of Maisie Stuart; he's not observant enough to
know her inside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> What a perfectly horrible thing to say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Well, it's absolutely true; he thinks she's everything that's
good and noble, when all the time she's painfully ordinary and a bit of
a cat; what fools men are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>blasé</i>). One can't help falling in love.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>downstairs followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>; <i>she is a pretty<br />
little woman with rather a plaintive manner.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>as she descends</i>). Bobbie says you all want to talk to
me! What's the matter, darlings? (<i>Comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> That's what we want to know, mum; come on now, out with it.
You've been looking worried for ever so long.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>stays at foot of stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I don't know what you mean, Sylvia dear I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Now listen to me, mother; you've got something on your mind,
that's obvious to any one; you're not a bit good at hiding your
feelings. Surely we're all old enough to share the worry, whatever it
is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> (<i>kissing her</i>). Silly old darlings&mdash;it's true I have been
a little worried&mdash;you see, we're ruined.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>The girls rise.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>shaking her head sadly</i>). Yes, we're ruined; we haven't a
penny. (<i>Moves to chair below table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Why didn't you tell us before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>sitting</i>). I only knew it myself this morning, I had a
letter from Tibbets; he's been through all the papers and things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> Father's papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I suppose so, dear. There wouldn't be any others, would
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>coming down</i>). But mother, what did he say, how did he put it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I really forget&mdash;but I know it worried me dreadfully.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>sits on form.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> And we literally haven't a penny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Well, only fifteen hundred a year; it's almost as bad.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>sits in armchair.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Shall we have to give up the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I'm afraid so, darling; you see there are taxes and rates
and things. Tibbets knows all about it&mdash;he's coming down to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Can't Uncle Daniel do anything?</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>sits on table.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> He's my only hope. I cabled to South America three weeks
ago. I didn't know the worst then, but I felt I wanted some one to lean
on&mdash;after all, his cheque was a great help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Is he very, very rich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> He must be, he's a bachelor, and he has a ranch and a mine
and things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Has he answered your cable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> No, but of course he may have been out prospecting or
broncho-breaking or something when it arrived. They live such restless
lives out there&mdash;oh, no, I don't think he'll fail me, he's my only
brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> I wonder how much he <i>has</i> got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Perhaps Tibbets will know&mdash;we'll ask him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Why, is he Uncle Daniel's lawyer as well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> No, dear, but you know lawyers are always clever at
knowing other people's business&mdash;I shall never forget&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Yes&mdash;but mother, what will happen if he <i>isn't</i> rich, and
doesn't help us after all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I really don't know, darling. It's terribly upsetting,
isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> It will be <i>awful</i> having to give up the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Well, Tibbets says we needn't for another two years. It's
paid for until then or something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>sits on the Chesterfield</i>). Thank heaven! What a relief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> But we shall have to be awfully careful. Oh, darlings
(<i>she breaks down</i>), thank God I've got you. (<i>Weeps on</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie's</span>
<i>knee.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Buck up mother, it isn't as bad as all that. After all, we can
work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>without enthusiasm</i>). Yes, we can work. (<i>Moving from table to</i>
<span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> I shall write things, really artistic little fragments&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> We want to make money, Vangy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> But, darlings, you know you can't make money unless you're
Socialists and belong to Unions and things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> Well, I know <i>I</i> should make money in time. There's a great
demand for really good stuff now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Do you think yours <i>is</i> really good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> I'm sure it is.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>reads a magazine.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Well, God help the bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>rising</i>). Look here, Bobbie, I'm tired of your silly
jeering at me. Just stop trying to be funny. (<i>Moves to</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>hotly</i>). I realize the futility of endeavour when I see how
funny others can be <i>without</i> trying (<i>following her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> Ill-bred little pip squeak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>jumping up; firing</i>). He's not a pip squeak. Fanny Harris says
he's the most good-looking boy she's ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. She can't have seen many then. (<i>Moves to fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh! Don't betray your jealousy of my looks, Evangeline. It's so
degrading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>My dears!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. What is it, mother, quick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>reading</i>). Arrive this afternoon&mdash;about tea time, Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Uncle Daniel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. In England!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I suppose so. It was handed in at Charing Cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. What luck! (<i>Gets off table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. We're saved&mdash;oh, my darlings! (<i>She breaks down again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. He may not have any money after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. He'd never have got across so quickly if he hadn't. (<i>She
sniffs.</i>) Oh, it's too, too wonderful&mdash;I have not seen him for six
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. As a matter of fact it is jolly decent of him to be so prompt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Where's Oliver? He ought to be here to welcome him too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<span class="smcap">c</span>.). Oliver has gone for a brisk walk, to keep fit he said, as
if it made any difference whether he kept fit or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. It makes a lot of difference, dear. He is the athletic one
of the family. (<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>is annoyed</i>.) I don't like the way you speak of
him, Bobbie. We can't all compose songs and be brilliant. You must try
and cultivate a little toleration for others, darling. (<span class="smcap">Oliver</span> <i>passes
window from</i> <span class="smcap">l</span>.) Oliver is a great comfort to me. Tibbets only said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>glancing out of the window</i>). Here he is, anyhow. Who's
going to tell him the news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>rising, goes to stairs</i>). Well, I've no time now, I must
change my dress for Daniel. Turn on the lights, Bobbie; make everything
look as cosy and festive as you can. (<i>On stairs.</i>) Run into the
kitchen, Joyce dear, and tell cook to make an extra supply of hot cakes
for tea. I'm sure Daniel will love them after being so long abroad and
living on venison and bully beef and things. (<i>Ascending, then turns.</i>)
You will all wash before tea, won't you, darlings? It's always so
important to make a good first impression, and he hasn't seen any of you
since you've been grown up. (<i>Glances in mirror.</i>) Oh! look at my face,
I look quite happy now.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>upstairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I think mother is rather mixing up North and South America; they
don't have such awful hardships where Uncle Daniel comes from.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Oliver</span> <i>from hall; he is a thick-set, determined-looking man<br />
of twenty-five.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Hallo! (<i>Crossing to table</i>, <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>going to him, excitedly</i>). Something wonderful has happened,
Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. We're ruined. I've just got to go and order extra teacakes. Isn't
it all thrilling?</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>into hall.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. What on earth's she talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It's perfectly true. We haven't any money, but Uncle Daniel's
coming to-day, and we're sure he'll help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>dazed</i>). Haven't any money, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>at fire</i>). Mother's been rather vague as usual, but we
gather that we're practically penniless, and that we shall have to give
up the house after two years unless something happens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Luckily Uncle Daniel is happening&mdash;this afternoon. Mother's just
had a wire from him&mdash;he's certain to be rich, mother says.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>leaning against stairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Because he's a bachelor, and has been living in South America
for five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Six years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Six years&mdash;mother said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. No, she didn't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Well, it doesn't matter. How does mother know we're penniless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>). She heard from Tibbets this morning, he's coming
down to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>sinking into chair</i>). By Jove, what a muddle!</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>re-enters, crosses to chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>, <i>takes coat and exits up stairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It's all quite clear when you think it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>). We've all got to wash and make ourselves look clean and
sweet for Uncle Daniel. Your collar's filthy; you'd better go and change
it quickly. He may be here at any minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Turn on the lights, Bobbie&mdash;and do let's hurry.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>turns up the lights and goes upstairs followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>goes up slowly after them.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. What a muddle! What a muddle! (<i>As he crosses to stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>following him</i>). What a muddle! What a muddle! (<i>Turns on
stairs.</i>) Shall I put on my emerald green tea gown? (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. No, dear; it's ever so much too old for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>piqued</i>). I don't think it's at all too old for me. I shall
certainly put it on.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>She disappears upstairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>is left alone. Suddenly there comes
a loud peal at the front door bell.</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>sees some half-made

<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>shrinks back by stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Griggs</span> (<i>assisting him off with his coat</i>). If you will wait, sir, I'll
tell Mrs. Dermott you are here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Thank you. (<i>Goes round to fireplace, warms hands, turns.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Griggs</span> <i>has meanwhile taken his coat into the lobby.</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>creeps
cautiously from behind and goes towards stairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>looks
round and sees her. He watches her in silence for a moment, as
she goes up a few stairs.</i>)</p>

<p>Excuse me&mdash;have you been stealing anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>jumping</i>). Oh, Uncle Daniel&mdash;I didn't want you to see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I wanted to change my frock and do my hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. It looks quite charming as it is&mdash;I suppose you are Evangeline?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. No I'm not, I'm Sylvia. (<i>Coming to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>below Chesterfield</i>). Sylvia! I didn't know there was a
Sylvia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<span class="smcap">R.C.</span>, <i>laughing</i>). I was having concussion last time you were
here, having cut my head open on a door scraper at school. Naturally you
wouldn't remember me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Oh, but I do now, you were the sole topic of conversation at
lunch. How foolish of me to have let you slip my memory. Where are all
the others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. They're upstairs improving on the Almighty's conception of them
as much as possible in your honour; I was just going to do the same when
you caught me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You looked extraordinarily furtive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. And untidy. We've just been having a sort of family conference.
It was very heating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I think you might have waited for me&mdash;I'm a most important
factor. What were you discussing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Oh&mdash;er&mdash;ways and means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I see, it's as bad as that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. But you wait until mother comes. She'll explain everything. I'll
go and hurry her up. (<i>She goes up stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Don't leave me all alone. I'm a timid creature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>turns</i>). After all that Broncho busting! I don't think!</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>upstairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Broncho busting! What on earth does she mean? (<i>He walks slowly
to fireplace and stands with his back to it.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>down stairs. They meet</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Danny! Danny! darling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>). Anne! (<i>He kisses her fondly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, my dear, you have been away such a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>he turns her round to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>). Well, this is splendid&mdash;you do look
fit! Do you know I've often longed to be home. I've imagined winter
afternoons just like this&mdash;with a nice crackly fire and tea and muffins
in the grate. (<i>Pulling her on Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh well, they're not in the grate yet, dear, but they will
be soon. I ordered a special lot because I knew you loved them.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>He sits beside her; she is nearest the fire.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I can never thank you enough for sending the cheque,
Danny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Oh, rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. It was the greatest help in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I started for home the very moment I heard you were in trouble;
has everything been very, very trying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Only during the last few days. You see, George hadn't been
near me for four years before he died, so it wasn't such a terrible
shock as it might have been. Of course, he was my husband, and it was
upsetting, but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. He behaved like a beast to you, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Well, he's dead now&mdash;but don't let's discuss my affairs.
Tell me about yourself; what have you been doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. That can wait. Considering that the sole object of my coming to
England was to help you, I think we ought to concentrate. Tell me now,
has he left you very badly off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Well, Tibbets says we're ruined, but you know what Tibbets
is. Such a pessimist!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Tibbets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Yes, our lawyer, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Do I? How much have you got?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I think Tibbets said about fifteen hundred; of course we
can't keep the house and family going on that, can we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Of course we can't. What do the children intend to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Well, they don't quite know, poor darlings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Poor darlings! Is Oliver at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Yes. He's going to be a barrister or an engineer. He's
very vague about it, but has been learning Pelmanism, so I know he's
going to be something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I see. Bobbie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Bobbie, he's so young. Of course, it's not his fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. He composes, you know&mdash;beautiful little songs,&mdash;mostly
about moonlight. Evangeline writes the words. She is <i>very</i> artistic,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. What does Sylvia do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, she helps me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. In what way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh&mdash;er&mdash;she&mdash;well&mdash;she does the flowers, and comes calling
with me, and she's <i>invaluable</i> at jumble sales, when we have them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. And the youngest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Joyce? Oh, she's still at school&mdash;she's going to Roedean
next year to be finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Finished? Oh, I see! Well! They sound a pretty hopeless lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Danny, how can you be so horrid? Why, they're all
darlings! You can't expect them to work. They've not been brought up to
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I think it's about time they started.</p>

when we all start reminiscencing. (<i>Goes</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>kissing him</i>). We've been simply longing for you to come home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Little Joyce&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Joyce moves to top of table</i>)</p>

last saw you!</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>smiles at her.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. May I say that it gives me immeasurable joy to be here once more
in the bosom of my family. (<i>Sits on Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. We're not really your family, but never mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I don't. But I have looked forward to this moment through the
long sun-scorched nights with the great dome of the sky above me&mdash;shapes
have drifted out of the surrounding blackness and beckoned to me, crying
"Home, home" in depressing voices. I have heard the sand-bug calling to
its mate. "Home," it said, and bit me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Lots of things&mdash;gold mining, ranching, auction&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Auction? (<i>Leaning on table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Is it a very wonderful life, Danny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Occasionally&mdash;on good days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. How do you mean, good days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rather embarrassed</i>). Well&mdash;er&mdash;just good days.</p>

restless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. It would make a man of you, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I should simply loathe that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. So should I between ourselves, but still&mdash;&mdash;. Oh, by the way,
I&mdash;I have something rather important to say to you, you must prepare
yourselves for a shock&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>He dabs his eyes with his

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Oh, uncle, tell us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I&mdash;er&mdash;it's this. I consulted my doctor just before I sailed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. He&mdash;he gave me just three years to live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Danny, what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>firmly</i>). It's true&mdash;three years, he said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. It's the most awful thing. Tell us why&mdash;what's the matter
with you? (<i>Quickly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rather staggered</i>). The matter with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Yes, of course, you must see a specialist at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>pulling himself together dramatically</i>). No specialist in the
world could ever do me any good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Well, what is it? For God's sake tell us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>takes big breath</i>). Sleeping sickness! (<i>Smiles broadly at</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. What!! (<i>They all move.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes, it's frightfully prevalent out there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Danny, I hope its not infectious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Sleeping sickness! By Jove!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes, I simply daren't go to sleep without an alarm clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Danny darling, it's all too dreadful&mdash;I can't believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>rising</i>). But, uncle, I thought sleeping sickness polished you
off in one night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>embarrassed</i>). So it does, but that one night won't happen to
me for three years. The doctor says so. He knows. You see I've got it
internally or something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>firmly</i>). You must never go back there&mdash;you shall stay
with us until&mdash;until&mdash;the end&mdash;&mdash;</p>

(<i>She looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>rather angrily.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rising</i>). I'm sorry I have upset you, Anne. But I have told you
this to-day with a purpose in my mind. (<i>Moving to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. A purpose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of arm-chair</i>). Yes, I have a few words to say to you
all&mdash;words which, though they may sound a little mercenary, are in
reality prompted by very deep feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Poor Danny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Ssh! (<i>waves her to silence</i>). It may seem to all of you "banal"
in the extreme to talk of money on an occasion such as this, but believe
me, it's best to get it over. I came over to England this time, as I
have said, with a purpose&mdash;one might almost say a double purpose.
Firstly, to comfort my sister, your dear mother, in her hour
of&mdash;er&mdash;tribulation. (<i>He pauses.</i>) If you would just say "yes" or
"quite so" whenever I pause, it would help me enormously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. All right, we will.</p>

Anything else&mdash;but not sleeping sickness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I believe it is very comfortable, but that is neither here nor

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. How do you mean "Made good"?</p>

already write verses about the moonlight. They all start like that, only
unfortunately some of them stay like it. (<i>She sits again.</i>) You,
Bobbie, you are artistic, too, you might without undue strain become a
world famed composer, artist, actor. (<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>rises, moves down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>,

going to do with yourself? Sit at home and wait for a nice husband with
mediocre prospects and perhaps an over-developed Adam's apple? Never,
never! You too must rise and go forth&mdash;the world is calling to you. Do
what you will. I can't think of a career for you at the moment, but no
matter. I only want to impress upon you all the necessity of making good
at something&mdash;make good, make good, make good! And the one I consider
has done best for himself and the family name, to him&mdash;or her&mdash;I will

<h3><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II"></a>ACT II.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Scene</span> <i>is the same as Act I. Eighteen months have elapsed.
All the windows are wide open. It is a glorious summer day.
Alterations in the furniture are noted at the end of the play. At
the table</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>is seated when the</i> <span class="smcap">Curtain</span> <i>rises,
typewriting slowly but firmly. There are a lot of papers strewn
about. On the piano there is a sort of a pastry board to which is
affixed a working model of a motor engine in miniature.</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>is
seated at table</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span> <i>laboriously copying out a sheet of music on
to some manuscript paper.</i> </p>


<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>showing music</i>). Is it a crotchet or a quaver that has a waggle
on the end of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. I haven't the remotest idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. I do think Bobbie might write them a little more distinctly, it's
awfully difficult to copy.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>hums.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. I don't wish to appear surly or disagreeable to my younger
sister, but if you don't stop squawking I shall hurl something at you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Oh, all right. (<i>She hums louder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>). Joyce, you really are maddening; you
know perfectly well that I have to revise and retype an entire short
story which in itself is a nerve-racking job, and all you do is to
burble and sing, and gabble. Can't you be quiet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Why don't you go and work in your own room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Because it would be neither comfortable or proper with three
inquisitive painters there, running up and down the kitchen steps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Oh, I'd forgotten.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>hums again.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. But if you desire to continue your noises, may I suggest
that you do your music in the summer house. There's a nice firm table
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. No thanks, I'm quite comfy here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Well, I'm sorry to hear it.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>from hall. Goes to table and tidies papers.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Vangy dear, I <i>do</i> think you might have made the hall look
a little tidier. We shall have Mrs. Crombie and Faith here soon. It
really is tiresome of Bobbie to have made me ask them, specially as
Uncle Daniel's coming too. They'll be terribly in the way and we shall
have to make conversation instead of listening to Uncle Daniel's
thrilling stories. (<i>Goes to Chesterfield and tidies papers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. I can't think why you didn't wire and put them off
yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Because Bobbie would have been miserable and sulky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. He's very inconsiderate. I don't think you ought to give in
to him so much, mother; it only makes him worse. What he can see in that
tiresome little cat beats me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. She's awfully pretty.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>merely takes papers from one place to another, frequently<br />
dropping some, as she is "tidying up."</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. And entirely brainless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Well, we can be thankful that Mrs. Crombie isn't staying over the
week-end. One day of her is bad enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>tidying papers on form</i>). You mustn't talk like that,
dear. After all they are our guests and Bobbie's friends, and we must be
kind even if we don't like them very much. (<i>Picking up waste paper
basket from the front of table.</i>) I'm only worrying because darling
Daniel may be hurt at our having strangers in the house when he arrives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Oh, Uncle Dan won't mind. He's probably used to face polar bears
and things in his shack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. But it seems hard luck to leave raging bears on one side of
the Atlantic and meet Mrs. Crombie on the other.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>goes into screams of laughter and then chokes.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). Darling&mdash;do be careful. (<i>Drops papers and
puts waste paper basket through window</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span> <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>
<i>downstairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>continues to tidy up room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Nothing much, only your crochets and quavers have sent our
little ray of sunshine into a rapid decline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Have you done it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>weakly</i>). The top treble thing's a little wobbly, but I'll ink
it over afterwards.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>is tidying window seat.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>kissing her hurriedly and loudly</i>). Thanks, you're a lamb. I'll
try it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Oh! Bobbie, don't try it now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I shall. (<i>He goes to piano, then turns furiously.</i>) Well,
really it is the <i>limit</i>. Why can't Oliver keep his rotten engine in the
shed. It will scratch all the polish. (<i>He takes the model off piano and
bangs it on to the floor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Bobbie, don't break that thing. Oliver's <i>so</i> proud of
it. I can't think why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Well, I wish he'd go and be proud of it somewhere else. Look
here, three distinct scratches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Never mind dear. Griggs will get them out with sandpaper
or something.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>commences to play over the manuscript</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>has just
copied. Occasionally he stops and alters something with a pencil.
No one takes any notice. The dialogue goes on just the same.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Coming down to</i> <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>.) If you've nearly finished, Vangy dear, do
put the typewriter away. It looks so untidy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>rather crossly, rising</i>). Of course I quite see that until
my room's done, I shall never be able to do any work at all. (<i>Puts
cover on typewriter, then pushes table up to back</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Don't be cross, darling. You know how worried I am over
everything this morning. It's one long rush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>kissing her</i>). Sorry dear. I quite understand, only I must
have this story sent to the <i>Clarion</i> by Tuesday. If not, it won't be
out until the August number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. You're a dear darling, and you work terribly hard. I only
hope you won't overdo it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Oh no, these stories are only pot boilers. They just fill in
the time until my next novel is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>suddenly.</i>). Listen, don't you think this is a ripping change?
(<i>He plays a few chords. He then sits back complacently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Perfectly lovely, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. It sounds very much like everything else to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Only because you haven't got any ear. As a matter of fact
they're quite good chords. I shall put them into the new tomb-stone
cycle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Don't alter many of my words, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Not many, but the bit about "worms gnawing the grave of my
beloved" is a little too gloomy. Couldn't you make it butterflies?</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>giggles.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Don't be silly, Bobbie! butterflies don't live in graves.
Well, you can use the first two verses as they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I will.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>He starts to play again</i>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>is just going towards the
stairs when there comes a ring and knock at the front door.</i>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>rising</i>). My goodness, the Crombies&mdash;I must go and wash. I'm
covered in ink. (<i>Going to stairs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i>). I shouldn't worry, dear, they'll be
so overdressed themselves they will amply make up for any deficiencies
in our appearances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. I think I'd better go all the same. I must do my hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Don't dazzle them too much, dear.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>upstairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span> <i>crosses in corridor to open front door.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>going to corridor</i>). I'll be in presently, mother. I've
left my note-book in the summer house, and I'm afraid of forgetting it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>still at piano</i>). You'll meet them on the doorstep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. No, I shan't. I'm going through the drawing room window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>going to her, drops quantity of papers</i>). I'm so glad you
were able to come, dear Mrs. Crombie. How are you, Faith dear? (<span class="smcap">Faith</span>

up in the Ford, but Sylvia has taken the car up to Town to meet my

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R.C.</span>). Not at all, we didn't expect to be met at all.
It's such a little way. Well, Bobbie, have you been writing any more
successes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>laughing</i>). I think I've done one or two bad enough to be good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Oh, mother, isn't he cynical?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>). He always talks like that. Fancy, he says his Rose
song is bad. Fancy that wonderful Rose song. I'm always humming it.
(<i>Hums few notes of "The Rosary,"</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>attempting to stop her.</i>)
Well, I forget it now, but I love it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. You're lucky even to have a small garden in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>in anguish&mdash;moving slightly</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>). Ask mother! But that's no
use. Why, my mother could never make me care for someone I didn't want
to, or not care for some one I did. Don't you see what I mean. If you
are ever going to care for me you will have to do it on your own. Love
isn't a thing to be ordered about at will. Love is wonderful&mdash;glorious,
but above all, it's individual&mdash;you can't guide it. Why, you might fall
in love with a taxi driver or a dope fiend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Mother would never allow me to <i>know</i> a dope fiend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of Chesterfield&mdash;firmly</i>). But if you <i>did</i>, your mother's
opinion wouldn't have any effect at all&mdash;not if you had it in your
heart&mdash;really and truly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Mother's disapproval might stop me falling in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. No, it mightn't&mdash;nothing could stop it. On the contrary it would
probably strengthen it; opposition always does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>doubtfully</i>). Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I'm sure of it, but anyhow, I'm going to tell you something.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>appears at window</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span> <i>with telegram.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Bobbie, darling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>irritably</i>). What is it, mother? (<i>Goes up to window.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>powders her nose, etc.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I've just received the oddest telegram. We met the boy in
the drive. Do listen, I can't understand it. (<i>She reads.</i>) "Come to
lunch Monday and discuss Royalties&mdash;Claverton." What <i>does</i> it all mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. It's not for you, it's for Vangy. Claverton's her publisher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. What on earth do they want to discuss Royalties for. It
sounds <i>so</i> snobbish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Mother, at times you're inimitable. Royalties means
money, so much per cent., you know. We've explained it heaps of times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Of course, dear, how stupid of me; but still it is very
muddling, when they call things by fancy names like that. Put it on the
mantelpiece and give it to Vangy when she comes in.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>She disappears.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Mother never will grasp the smallest technicality.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Coming down to fireplace, he puts the telegram on the mantelpiece.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. You were going to tell me something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Yes, I know something that will banish your mother's disapproval
altogether....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. She hasn't disapproved yet. I only said she might.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Well, she's pretty certain to want you to make a good match. I
know what mothers are, they all do. I'm not a good match I know, but
what she doesn't know is that I have wonderful prospects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>with interest</i>). Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I should never have proposed to you, otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Well, you haven't proposed properly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I mean to when I've told you everything. Will you listen?
(<i>Moves to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Well, have you ever met my Uncle Daniel? (<i>Sits by her on
Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. You will to-day, he's a wonderful chap. Eighteen months ago his
doctor told him that he only had three years to live. (<span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>giggles.</i>)
And the day he came over from South America he gave us all a jolly good
talking to&mdash;quite right too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. You see father had left mother badly off, and we were all
drooping round doing nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Then Uncle Dan turned up and said he'd leave his whole fortune
to the one of us who made good in some way or other. Of course that
bucked us up no end, and look at us now&mdash;Vangy's raking in the dibs with
her novel, Sylvia's on a fair way to be a big film star, Oliver has just
been made assistant manager at the motor works, which is a good leg-up
considering that he started as an ordinary mechanic. I'm doing jolly
well out of my songs&mdash;specially "The Rose of Passion Sweet." Why they
buy the beastly thing I don't know. It's the worst of the lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Oh! Bobbie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Even Joyce has walked off with all the prizes at school and
intends to be a great artist. You see we've all risen to the bait.
Eighteen months ago it seemed providential that Uncle should only have
such a short time to live, now I rather hate it, in spite of the money.
He's a dear, though of course we didn't see much of him. He went back to
South America soon after he'd seen us, but still he left an impression.
Here we are, all working like slaves, and helping mother to keep on the
house. It would have broken her heart to have given it up. There are my
prospects&mdash;a huge fortune, quite soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Yes, but, Bobbie, one of the others might get it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>after looking round</i>). Ah, but there is just one more thing to
tell you. Two days before he sailed Uncle Dan took me aside and told
me&mdash;in the very strictest confidence of course&mdash;that I was the one out
of us all that he had his eye on; he said he'd practically made out his
will in my favour already....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>ecstatically</i>). Bobbie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Yes, but promise you won't breathe a word to the others; of
course you understand he couldn't show favouritism openly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. No&mdash;I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Now that I have told you everything, Faith darling, will
you&mdash;will you marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Yes, Bobbie&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh! (<i>He kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;if mother says I may.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh! (<i>mastering slight irritation</i>). But don't you think she
will, now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Yes, I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>sadly</i>). I don't believe you love me a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>filled with reproach</i>). Oh, Bobbie, how <i>can</i> you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Well, do you?</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> <i>sees them through window</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Of course, silly! (<i>She kisses him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>joyfully&mdash;taking her hands</i>). Oh, Faith we'll have the most
wonderful times in the world&mdash;just you and me together; say you're
happy, say you're excited about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. I'm absolutely thrilled&mdash;I'm&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>sees</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Crombie</span>. <i>Picks up papers on floor to hide his confusion.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. <i>They get up.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> (<i>going</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>). You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,
sitting indoors on a lovely day like this. (<span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>giggles.</i>) Heaven
knows we get little enough good air in town, without wasting it when we
get into the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Mother, something important has happened. (<i>By front of couch.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>sincere</i>). Look here, Faith, you must let me tell her&mdash;it's my
job, I won't shirk it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Don't be silly, Bobbie, go into the garden, there's a
darling&mdash;I'll come out in a minute or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Do be sensible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh, all right.... (<i>Goes up between Chesterfield and fireplace,
and exits into garden.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. You are a little fool, Faith. Fancy flirting with
that&mdash;the elder one has much more in him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. But I don't like Oliver so much, his chin's so scrubby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Oliver is a steady man with an assured career in front of
him&mdash;this one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Mother, we're engaged!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Of course you are. That has been perfectly obvious from
the moment I passed the window. Now of course we have all the trouble of
getting you disengaged again. Really you are very tiresome. (<i>Below
table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Mother, how can you be so horrid, you will <i>not</i> understand!
Bobbie has ever so much better prospects than Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Who said so? Bobbie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Yes, but it's true; his Uncle is going to leave him a huge
fortune in a year's time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Which Uncle? (<i>Takes out cigarette from case.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. He's only got one&mdash;Daniel Davis. He landed in England yesterday,
and is coming down here to-day. Eighteen months ago the doctor said he
only had three years to live&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. I've been caught like that before. (<i>Crosses to
mantelpiece for matches.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Why, how do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Experience has taught me one thing, and that is that in
this world people <i>never</i> die when they're expected to. (<i>Sits on
Chesterfield.</i>) The old man will probably live to a ripe old age, then
where would you be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Well, anyhow Bobbie makes quite a lot out of his songs. (<i>Sits in
armchair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Don't be childish, Faith. You know perfectly well I should
never allow you to marry a man without a settled income&mdash;prospects never
kept anyone. Besides, if any of them get the uncle's money it will be
Oliver&mdash;he's the eldest. (<i>Lights cigarette.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>in chair</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>). That's where you are wrong, mother. Just before
he sailed back to America, he took Bobbie aside and told him in
confidence that he was the one he meant to leave everything to. Of
course the others mustn't know because it would be favouritism&mdash;don't
you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. How much is he going to leave?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. I don't know, but it's sure to be a lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Well, he's a bachelor and&mdash;and he's been mining in South America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. There are hundreds of bachelors in South America who are
absolutely penniless&mdash;whether they mine or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. You are horrid, mother. (<i>Sniffs.</i>) I did feel so happy, and I
wanted you to be happy too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> (<i>with slight sarcasm</i>). It was sweet of you, dear. I
really can't work myself up to a high pitch of enthusiasm over an uncle
who though apparently in the last throes of a virulent disease is well
able to gallop backwards and forwards across the Atlantic gaily
arranging to leave an extremely problematic fortune to an extremely
scatter-brained young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Bobbie isn't <i>scatter</i>-brained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. The whole family is scatter-brained, and I expect the
uncle's the worst of the lot&mdash;he wouldn't have been sent to South
America otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. He wasn't <i>sent</i>, he went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. How do you know? He probably did something disgraceful in
his youth and had to leave the country. Just like my brother, your Uncle
Percy. I'm certain there's a skeleton of some kind in this
family&mdash;anyhow he's sure not to die when we want him to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. The doctor said three years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Only to frighten him, that's what doctors are for. I
believe they cured hundreds of cases in the army like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Did they, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. What's the matter with the man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. It strikes me, dear, that you had better find out a bit
more before you get engaged another time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>tearfully</i>). But I don't want to be engaged another time. I want
to be engaged this time. Oh, mother darling, won't you wait a little
while? Just <i>see</i> the uncle. If you got him alone for a while you could
find out anything&mdash;you're always so clever at that sort of thing. Oh,
mother, do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. I'll interview the man on one condition. That is that
whatever decision I may make you promise to abide by it afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>rises</i>). Yes, mother, I promise. (<i>Kisses her, remains below
fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Now I suppose we had better join the rest, they're being
feverishly bright on the tennis lawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Ah, there you are, Mrs. Crombie; you were bored with
watching tennis too. Of course Oliver and Joyce's efforts cannot really
be called tennis, but still it's an amusement for them. (<i>Sits in

certain I left it here.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>sits on form</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Thank you so much, dear. You know, Mrs. Crombie, I
imagined that all authors became terribly superior after a little time,
but Vangy hasn't a bit&mdash;it is such a relief to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. I haven't read her book yet; I must really order it from
Boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, you belong to Boots too, I did for years&mdash;there's
something so fascinating in having those little ivory marker things with
one's name on them, but, of course, I had to give it up when the crash
came.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>with knitting.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Here you are, mother. (<i>Crosses to below table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Thank you so much, darling. Do you know, Mrs. Crombie, I
started this at the beginning of the War and I haven't finished it yet?
I do hope you are not being terribly dull here, Mrs. Crombie. (<i>Drops
ball of wool.</i>) I'm afraid we're awfully bad at entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Not at all. You are one of those excellent hostesses who
allow their guests to do as they like, it's so much more comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>rising</i>). I think I'll go and talk to Bobbie in the garden.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Goes between Chesterfield and armchair.</i>)<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Your daughter is a dear girl, Mrs. Crombie&mdash;we are all so
fond of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. It's charming of you&mdash;she simply loves being down here. Of
course it is so good for her to get away from London for a little while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I only wish we could have put you up as well, but really
with all the children at home, there's no room at all. I was only saying
to Tibbets&mdash;my solicitor, you know&mdash;that the one thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. I understand perfectly. Anyhow, I can never leave my
husband for long&mdash;men are so selfish, aren't they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Sometimes I'm afraid, but still they're rather darlings
when you know how to manage them. Vangy, dear, did I tell you how many
stitches I set on this sleeve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. We have many confidences, mother, but that is not one of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Dear me, how tiresome. I'm certain I told someone.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>She gets up and rings bell above fireplace, and sits down again.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. I was saying, Miss Dermott, that I must make an effort to
get your book from the library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Oh, there are one or two copies in the house&mdash;I'll lend you
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. It's very kind of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I'm sure you'll like it, I did, though Vangy tells me I
didn't understand half of it. Naturally being my daughter's work it

always been most careful with the children's upbringing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Did I? Now what on earth could it have been? Was it a

<p><span class="smcap">Griggs</span>. Quite calm, madam.</p>

<p>Really, I don't know what I should do without that man. I believe he's
Scotch, but he's quite invaluable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. So it seems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Will Sylvia and Uncle Daniel be here in time for dinner,
mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Yes, his train arrived at Euston at eleven-thirty. They
ought to be here quite soon now, unless, of course, anything has
happened to the car&mdash;but still, Sylvia drives very carefully. They
taught her to do lots of things like that on the films, you
know&mdash;they're awfully daring&mdash;I shall never forget when they made her
jump off Westminster Bridge on a horse&mdash;my sister Amy was scandalized,
and I said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. I can <i>quite</i> imagine it. It was very plucky of your
daughter to do it, though I'm glad Faith isn't on the films&mdash;I should be
worried to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Of course I felt like that at first&mdash;but one gets hardened
to anything&mdash;even my poor brother's approaching death seems less
terrible now&mdash;at the time when he told us it was a fearful shock, but
somehow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. It must be terribly sad for you. Faith told me about it
this morning. What is he suffering from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Well, to tell you the truth, we don't quite know, he will
joke about it so&mdash;at first he said it was "Sleeping Sickness" and then
"Creeping quickness" or pneu-somnia or something or other&mdash;one comfort,
he doesn't seem to mind a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. Perhaps the doctor diagnosed the case all wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh yes, they are careless&mdash;aren't they? Did you say
"diagnosed," there now, that's the word you were trying to think of the

<p class="c">(<i>All except</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>go out to meet</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. <i>All

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Danny, darling&mdash;let me introduce you to Mrs.
Crombie&mdash;my brother. And this is Faith&mdash;such a dear girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. How do you do. I've heard so much about you. Are you
feeling better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<span class="smcap">L.C.</span>, <i>jovially</i>). Better! Why, I never had a day's illness in
my life&mdash;(<i>look from all</i>)&mdash;at least&mdash;that is until I had the illness.
Yes, it's very tiresome. (<i>He gulps.</i>) A short life and a gay one, you
know. (<i>He laughs forcedly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Danny, darling, I <i>do</i> hope&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Nonsense, dear&mdash;there is no hope&mdash;but that's a comfort to me. I
always imagine hope weary after a game of blind man's buff sitting on an
orange&mdash;so uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>sit below and</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table respectively.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>sits Chesterfield, dabbing her eyes</i>). Really, Danny, you
are too absurd.... I'm so glad Sylvia brought you safely, I never really
feel happy in my mind when she's out with the car. It's not really
woman's work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>sitting armchair</i>). As far as I can gather from what she has
been telling me&mdash;filming seems to require a certain amount of unwomanly
abandon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>at back of Chesterfield, laughing</i>). I was only telling him
about that day in the middle of the village street, when I had to do
three "close ups" on top of one another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. It all sounds vaguely immoral to me, but I hope it's all
right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Define the expression "close up." What does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. When they bring the camera right up to your face and you have to
register various emotions&mdash;fear&mdash;suspicion&mdash;joy&mdash;yearning&mdash;sorrow&mdash;(<i>she
does them</i>) that's a close up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Isn't she wonderful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span>. It really is most entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I think they ought to film Evangeline's novel&mdash;it's chock full
of incident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>rising, poses by mantel</i>). Yes, uncle, but only
psychological incident&mdash;they want luridly exciting episodes for a real
thriller. I mean to write a scenario one day though, it's a money-making
game. (<i>Sits again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Do, dear&mdash;but please don't make the heroine jump out of
attic windows or anything&mdash;it <i>is</i> so trying for Sylvia&mdash;I shall never
forget Westminster Bridge and that horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. It appears to be a most dashing profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>with pride</i>). Oh, it is. Sylvia does the most thrilling
things, I assure you. She had to rescue the Rajah from a burning house
in Piccadilly only last Wednesday. It caused a great sensation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. So I should imagine, but why was the Rajah burning in
Piccadilly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, it wasn't a real Rajah of course&mdash;but he was supposed
to be in the clutch of Bolshevists&mdash;or was that another film, Sylvia?&mdash;I
get so muddled&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It was another film, mother, but it doesn't matter. How's your
illness, Uncle Dan? You look pretty bright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Oh, I expect to be quite cheery right up to the last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Danny dear, don't talk about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>with meaning</i>). I always think we attach too much importance to
life and death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> (<i>acidly</i>). It depends on circumstances, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>dramatically</i>). Out there where I come from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Go on, uncle, do tell us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I was just going to, only you interrupted me&mdash;out there on the
limitless prairie, a man's life is not considered worth that much. (<i>He
tries to snap his fingers without any success.</i>) There now, I can never
do that properly&mdash;that much. (<i>He tries again.</i>) Damn!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> I can do it, uncle. (<i>He does it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> So can I. (<i>She tries.</i>) Oh, no I can't&mdash;Sylvia, you can. You had
to when you were playing in "Spanish Passion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Never mind now, let uncle get on with his story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Out there Death waits round every corner&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> I didn't know there were any corners on the limitless prairie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>testily</i>). I was millions of miles away from any prairie&mdash;and,
anyhow, I was only speaking metaphorically.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> You are irritating, Bobbie, why can't you keep quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> There seems to be some doubt, Mr. Davis, as to what part
of America you were in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> South America&mdash;firmly South America&mdash;in the little tiny wee,
bijou village of Santa Lyta&mdash;far away from the beaten track, this lonely
place lies basking in the sun. Heavens, how it basked! its natives
care-free and irresponsible, dreaming idly through the long summer
heat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> What did you do there, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> What did you do there, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>coming to earth</i>). Oh, er&mdash;lots of things&mdash;fishing&mdash;yachting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> But I thought it was inland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> I thought it was inland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> So it is, but there's a lake, there's a lake! We used to sit
round the camp fire in the evenings and cook the fish&mdash;yes, salmon and
cucumber, and sing songs&mdash;sweet little homely ditties&mdash;your Rose song in
particular, Bobbie, was a great success, I must say that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Don't perjure yourself, uncle, I know perfectly well that it's
the worst thing that has ever been written.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> It's your most successful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Of course&mdash;I've made literally hundreds out of it&mdash;the public
wallow in it&mdash;roses and passion, and wine, and eyes of blue&mdash;it makes me
absolutely sick every time I hear it, but still one must write down in
this world if one wants to get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Speaking of roses, let's go out into the garden and
talk&mdash;it's so stuffy in here&mdash;you can tell me some more of your
adventures, Danny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>looking at him</i>). I'm sure he'd love to.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Every one gets up and drifts out on to the lawn talking.</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>
<i>hangs behind for a moment with</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). What did she say? (<i>Catching her hand as she is
going out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. She said she'll see&mdash;wait until to-night....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh, Faith darling....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Come out now, quick, or they'll miss us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>grumbling</i>). It doesn't matter if they do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Oh, yes, it does&mdash;I don't want to be talked about.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>They go out and bang into</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, <i>who is coming in.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Hallo, aren't you going to tell us things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>). No, not now&mdash;I must unpack&mdash;I'm feeling rather
tired&mdash;I have to change&mdash;I must send a wire.... The truth of the matter
is, I just want a little peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. All right, we'll leave you to it.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span>. <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>comes slowly down stage&mdash;lights
a cigar and settles himself in Chesterfield.</i>)<br />
(<i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, <i>quickly touches</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>on face&mdash;he jumps.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Uncle dear, why did you slip away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I explained to your brother&mdash;because I felt a little tired and
wanted a rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. You're not too tired to talk to me though, are you? (<i>Quite
quietly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>without conviction</i>). No. (<i>Lies full length.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Well, I'll sit down then. (<i>To side of Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Do. (<i>Sees she wants to sit down. He takes his legs off
Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. So you really are better? (<i>Sitting</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Of course I'm better&mdash;I feel splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. And you <i>still</i> believe what the doctor said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I always believe what every one says, I'm a most trusting
person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Oh, is that how you made your money&mdash;by being trusting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Certainly. I trusted other people to lose it and they did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. How d'you mean&mdash;lose it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, you see&mdash;look here, Sylvia, are you cross-examining me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Nothing could be further from my thoughts, uncle dear, I only
wondered, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, don't wonder any more&mdash;it's most embarrassing&mdash;what have
you been doing with yourself lately?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. You know perfectly well, uncle, because you sat next to me in
the car and I told you everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, tell me some more. Have you had any love affairs&mdash;girls
always like to confide their love affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Only when they haven't got any&mdash;but I don't, anyhow. The only
one of the family who has got it in the least badly is Bobbie; he's mad
on Faith Crombie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. So I gathered&mdash;why, do you suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. We can't think&mdash;she's the most irritating girl I've met for
years&mdash;and her mother's hateful, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Why are they here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Oh, Bobbie wanted them asked, and mother's much too sweet to
deny us anything in reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I shouldn't call Mrs. Crombie in reason&mdash;she's trying to pump
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. You are rather a mysterious person you know, uncle, I should
like to know lots more about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Everything about me is absolutely honourable and above board.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I don't know that it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. My dear Sylvia&mdash;you wound me, you grieve me&mdash;I feel deeply
pained. I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>laughing</i>). It's no use trying to bluster out of it, uncle, you
know as well as I do that it wasn't honourable of you to single me out
for your money without letting the others know anything about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>quickly</i>). You haven't told them, have you? (<i>Puts his feet
down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. No&mdash;I don't break <i>my</i> word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. And I don't break mine, so you needn't be so sniffy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It is breaking it in a way to show favouritism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I only told you in the very strictest confidence because I had
faith in you&mdash;trusted you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It was very sweet of you, uncle, but I don't think you should
have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, after all, I... it's my money and surely I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. You see, it's so terribly unfair to the others&mdash;of course they
don't know, and I shall never breathe a word, but, uncle, I do wish
you'd leave everything to one of them and not me&mdash;I shouldn't feel happy
for a moment with the money&mdash;not for a single moment if I'd known all
the time that I was going to get it. Rule me out of the list, there's a
dear&mdash;I'm earning an awful lot now, you know, on the films and I really
don't need any more&mdash;promise you'll do what I ask you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I don't think you're quite in your right mind, but,
still&mdash;(<i>smiling</i>) I'll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. There, I knew you'd see what I meant and be a lamb. Now tell me
some of your adventures and things, and how you made the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Really, I don't think that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It must be so glorious out there&mdash;mining and prospecting and&mdash;by
the way how does one prospect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. How does one prospect? When one prospects one scoops up water
from rivers and finds nuggets in one's hands&mdash;if one's lucky, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. You don't seem to know very much about it, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>nettled</i>). On the contrary I know <i>all</i> about it&mdash;but you
wouldn't understand if I went into technical details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I don't believe you would, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rises and goes</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>). I think, Sylvia, that this lack of trust
in your fellow-creatures is a very sinister trait in your character&mdash;you
must remember that I am a much older man than you are and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I'm not a man at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>turns</i>). Sometimes I wish you were, then I could tell you what
I really think of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>rises and goes to him&mdash;laughing</i>). There, uncle, I won't tease
you any more, but still it must have been a wonderful moment when you
discovered you had made a fortune out of your mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>relentlessly</i>). But I thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. That is&mdash;not exactly&mdash;you see it was like this....</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Oliver</span> <i>from garden.</i>)<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>above arm-chair</i>). Hallo Sylvia. Mother's been looking for
you&mdash;she wants you to help her pick strawberries for tea. Joyce is with
her now, but she isn't much use because she eats them as fast as she
picks them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I'll go now. Stay and keep Uncle Dan company, Oliver. Get him to
tell you some of his South American experiences. They're awfully
interesting. Bye-bye for the present, uncle.</p>

you, Oliver?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Of course, I'll get you one.</p>

<p>(<i>Weakly</i>) Thank you very much.</p>

a few minutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>apprehensively</i>). Yes&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>awkwardly</i>). Well, it's like this&mdash;I know it's rather bad form
to talk about your will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. But I feel I must. I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>hurriedly</i>). Wait until another time, don't you worry yourself
about it now. You wait until I'm dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>firmly</i>). No, I must get it over&mdash;I want to ask you to leave
your money to one of the others and not to me at all. It was awfully
decent of you to single me out and it bucked me up a lot to feel that
you thought well of me, but now&mdash;well, I'm earning steadily and I really
don't need a lot, in fact, it might do me harm to feel that I needn't
work&mdash;also it would seem frightfully caddish to the others for me to
have known all along that I was going to get it. Don't you see what I'm
driving at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. In a way, I do, yes....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Well, you'll do what I ask, won't you? It's a ripping feeling
being independent (<span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>passes the window</i>) and earning money,
and I want to go on at it&mdash;(<i>He glances out of the window</i>). Here comes
Vangy. Now leave it to her. Novel writing is a frightfully precarious

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I take it that yours is a gold mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Not so that you'd notice it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Well, I mean&mdash;it's not especially a gold mine&mdash;it's a mixed
mine&mdash;a little bit of everything&mdash;there's tin and silver and salt and
copper and brass, and God knows what&mdash;it's most exciting wondering what
we are going to find next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> Yes, so I should imagine....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Often on weary, dark nights&mdash;filled with the cries of the jackal
and the boa-constrictor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I didn't know boa-constrictors cried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Only when they are upset about something. Then they can't help
it. There are few animals as highly emotional as a boa-constrictor.
Anyhow, as I was saying, we lay awake in the throbbing darkness&mdash;the
darkness out there always throbs&mdash;it's a most peculiar phenomenon&mdash;and
wondered&mdash;Heavens, how we wondered what we should find on the following
day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> If you'll forgive my saying so, Mr. Davis, I fear that you
are a bit of a fraud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I said I thought you were a fraud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Of course I am&mdash;all great men are. Look at George Washington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> He wasn't a fraud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> We only have his word for it. Besides he knew his father had
seen him cut down the cherry tree. That's why he confessed. Anyhow, why
should you think I am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> Because you obviously know nothing about mining, and I
happen to know that there is no such thing as a mountain in South
America called the Grand Slam. I was determined to find out as much as I
could about you on account of my daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rises</i>). My dear madam, I assure you that there is nothing
whatever between your daughter and me&mdash;my intentions are absolutely
honourable. (<i>Moves to fireplace.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> (<i>coldly</i>). I was not alluding to you, but to your
nephew&mdash;your youngest nephew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Oh, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> He has been making love to her. This afternoon he proposed
to her....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Did he, by Jove!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> He also spoke about a large sum of money that you intended
to leave him&mdash;I'm sure you will understand my position&mdash;I naturally want
my daughter to marry well&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> And you mean to make quite sure of the money beforehand. I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> You put it rather crudely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I think matters of this kind are better discussed crudely. One
thing I will promise you, Mrs. Crombie. You shall know full particulars
of my finances and everything else by the end of the day. Until then I
fear that you must continue to regard me as a fraud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I hope you are not offended at my inquisitiveness, but I
really&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> My dear Mrs. Crombie, when you have knocked about the world as
much as I have&mdash;one learns never to be either surprised or shocked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> It is very, very hard for mothers, nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> The children are all so modern they become quite
ungovernable....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>coming forward slightly</i>). I can only say then that my nephews
and nieces are exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I am so glad you are so satisfied with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I am! I never realised until to-day how absolutely splendid it
was to be an uncle. How wonderfully proud I should be of the fact that
they are related to me. I came home eighteen months ago expecting to
find a family of irritating self-centred young people idling about&mdash;true
they were idling, but I liked them in spite of it&mdash;I have returned this
time to find them not only hard-workers, but successful hard-workers.
There is not one of them who hasn't achieved something&mdash;even Joyce, the
flapper, has set to and made good at school. I tell you I'm proud of
them, so proud that I could shout it from the house tops, and may I say
this, Mrs. Crombie, that if your daughter has succeeded in making Bobbie
fall in love with her, she is a very fortunate young woman.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> <i>shows boredom during speech.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> Oh, is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Because he is a fine boy, so is Oliver, so are they all
splendid&mdash;and she should be proud to know them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> It really is very lucky that you are so contented with
your lot. Personally, I'm not so ecstatic. Admitting for a moment that
your nephew has such a marvellously fine character&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;he
should not have made love to my daughter without being certain of his
prospects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I will speak to him, Mrs. Crombie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> I should be very grateful if you would. (<i>Rises and moves
up to him.</i>) And please understand that nothing&mdash;nothing is to be
settled without my consent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I quite understand that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie.</span> Thank you so much&mdash;I think I'll rejoin the others in the
garden now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> I'm sure they'd be charmed.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Crombie</span> <i>into garden.</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, <i>left alone, lights another<br />

</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>peeps downstairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Has she gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Yes, thank Heaven. I say, Vangy, she is a very objectionable
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>coming down</i>). I know&mdash;we all loathe her. Now at last I can
talk to you alone. (<i>Sits beside him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Look here, Evangeline, I know exactly what you are going to say,
and I settle it all on Griggs, if you like. He'll take it, he's a
Scotsman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. How did you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Instinct, my dear, pure instinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>rises</i>). Let's talk it all over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rises and goes</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>). No, not now, I must go up to my room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Oh, just a little talk!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I have some letters to write. Also I'm tired and I feel my
illness coming on again. Also I must wash before tea. Also&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>laughing</i>). It's quite obvious that you don't want to, so
I'll leave you alone. Cheerio for the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. They all say that. Cheerio! I'm sure it portends something....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Now you've just got to tell the others that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>flustered</i>). But I promised Bobbie I wouldn't say a word....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Well, you've broken your word once, so you can do it again.
Vangy! Vangy! (<i>She goes to window, still dragging</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span>.) Sylvia!

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. What on earth is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Look here, this isn't a bit fair of you. Bobbie will never

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Now, Faith, tell them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith.</span> I won't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Very well, I will&mdash;it's most important&mdash;listen, all of
you&mdash;Bobbie was flirting with Faith this afternoon, and he told her that
Uncle had singled him out from us all to leave his money to....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> Oh, Faith, how could you. (<span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>crosses to window</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>judiciously</i>). Is this true, Bobbie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>miserably</i>). Yes, but I couldn't help it....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> Of course you couldn't. Don't be silly&mdash;now <i>I'll</i> tell you
something. Uncle said exactly the same thing to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every one.</span> What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> So he did to me, the dirty dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Yes, I guessed as much when Faith told me&mdash;he promised his whole
fortune to me if I won prizes and things at school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> Well, I needn't tell you that he said the same to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie.</span> What's his game?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> You will in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> I shouldn't be too sure, if he's deceived us once, he'll
probably try to do it again. I don't feel that I can trust him at all
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Look here, when he comes down, what are we to say to
him&mdash;Oliver'd better do it all, he's the eldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>comes down to table</i>). I'm hanged if I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span> All right, dear, don't get crusty before the time; I expect

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You all appear to be perturbed about something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. We are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Shut up, Bobbie, I'm spokesman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>weakly</i>). Couldn't it be some one else? Sylvia's so firm with
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I think, uncle, that you occasionally need firmness. (<i>Coming
down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>by Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. We all do, it's a weakness of the human race&mdash;lack of stamina&mdash;I
have it at the moment. Please may I sit down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>sinking into arm-chair</i>). Thank you so much. (<i>Weakly.</i>) I
begin to feel sleepy. May I have perhaps&mdash;a small glass of water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. All right&mdash;I'll get it. (<i>He goes to sideboard.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. With perhaps the teeniest, weeniest little drop of whisky?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. This is all useless prevarication, you know&mdash;we have some very
important questions to ask you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rising</i>). Perhaps I'd better stand up then, it's more imposing.
(<i>He takes water from Bobbie.</i>) Thank you a thousand times. Cheerio!!</p>

<p class="c">(<i>They all make a movement of annoyance.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Now then, uncle, we've discovered that you have been deceiving
us....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>amazed</i>). I&mdash;deceive you? I'm pained! I'm hurt! You've wounded
me to the quick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I don't believe you've got a quick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Shut up, Bobbie!</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>is by window</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Yes, through the agency of Miss Crombie here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Ah, Miss Crombie, I've just been chatting to your mother. (<i>Goes
to table and puts glass on it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>ignoring his interruption.</i>) Your dastardly trick has been
exposed, is it or is it not true that you took each of us aside in turn
a year and a half ago and filled us up with confidential lies about your
will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>bravely</i>). It's absolutely true.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Move from all.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Why did you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>laughing with forced roguishness</i>). Ah!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>firmly&mdash;with emphasis on each word</i>). Why did you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Do you really want to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>below form</i>). Of course we do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Very well, then I'll tell you. The reason was this. You were a
set of idle young bounders. (<i>A move from all.</i>) You'd never done a
stroke of work in your lives&mdash;neither have I, but I didn't see why you
shouldn't. There was your poor mother left comparatively hard up&mdash;you
would have to have left this house which would have made her perfectly
miserable, so I determined to spur you on to do something (<i>breaking
into a smile.</i>) I say, you must admit I've succeeded!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Never mind, that&mdash;go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>still smiling</i>). Well, not having a penny in the world with
which to help you myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everyone</span>. What!!!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I repeat&mdash;not having a penny&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>below table</i>). Do you mean to say you haven't any money at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Not a bob! Except on the all too rare occasions
when I win a bit. (<i>Laughing.</i>) If it were not for the darling little
horses, I shouldn't be able to get across to England at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. What about the mine you told us of?</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>is</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of table.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I never told you of a mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Oh, uncle, you are a fibber!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You said I had a mine. As a matter of fact I am part owner in
one. Unfortunately it was long ago proved to be absolutely worthless.
But please don't worry yourselves over me. I shall be all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<span class="smcap">R.C.</span>). We weren't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<span class="smcap">C</span>). I didn't say you were, I said don't. I also told you, now
that I come to think of it, that I had only three years to live. That
was put in as a bit of local colour. I hope to live to eighty-two or
even eighty-three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>above Chesterfield</i>). Well, all I can say is&mdash;it's the
rottenest trick I ever heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Uncle, how could you? (<i>She sniffs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. How dare you come here and stuff us up with promises that you
can never keep. I'm jolly well fed up. I thought you were such a sport
and&mdash;oh, what's the use of talking. You don't give a damn. Come away,
Faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>tossing her head</i>). Very well.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span> <i>into garden.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>coming forward, moves between Chesterfield and
arm-chair&mdash;contemptuously</i>). It strikes me as being a singularly
pointless practical joke&mdash;I'm very disappointed in you, Uncle Daniel.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>coming in front of</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span>). So am I&mdash;damned disappointed. I

above all things and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. I could make you happy&mdash;wonderfully happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Mother doesn't think so. You see I've always been used to having
money and comforts and things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Do you imagine that I shouldn't have been able to give you all
the comforts you wanted whether I had uncle's money or not? Why, in a
year or so I shall be making hundreds and hundreds. I mean to be
successful&mdash;nothing will stop me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. Well, Bobbie, if you come to me again then, perhaps mother
would&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. You mean that I'm to go on working for my happiness on the off
chance of your being free to accept me? Neither you nor your mother have
enough trust in me to believe that I shall make a big name for myself.
Good God, it was a pretty thought of your parents to call you "Faith." I
suppose if you had a couple of sisters you'd call them Hope and Charity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. It's no use being angry and beastly about it. One must use a
little common sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. It isn't a question of common sense, but common decency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. How dare you say that. (<i>She pulls him round by the leg of his
trousers. He brushes her hand away. She repeats this business.</i>) Why
can't we just be friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. You know I'm much too fond of you to be just friends. Men can't
switch their feelings on and off like bath-taps. If they mean a thing
they mean it, and there's an end of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. I wish I'd never come down at all if all you mean to do is
grumble at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. It's more than grumbling&mdash;it's genuine unhappiness. (<i>Sits on
form below table.</i>) I quite realize now that you never really cared for
me a bit, in spite of what you said; but still I want to find out
why&mdash;<i>why</i> you've changed so suddenly, <i>why</i> need you have hurt me so
much. If you'd written breaking it off, it would have been different,
but you've been so&mdash;so unnecessarily brutal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. It was mother's fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Is everything you do your mother's affair? Does she count every
breath you take? Why, your life simply can't be worth living!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. I wish I could make you see....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>in a lower register</i>). I'm afraid you've made me see too much.
I didn't know people could be so callous and cruel....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>quickly</i>). I'm not callous and cruel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh yes, you are, and you've made me determine one thing, and
that is that henceforth I honestly mean to cut women out of my life for
ever. (<i>A move from</i> <span class="smcap">Faith</span>.) I know it's a hackneyed thing to say, but I
mean it. I ought to have taken a lesson from other fellows' experiences,
but of course I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>. I think you're very silly and childish to be so bitter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Bitter! (<i>Laughs satirically.</i>) What else could I be? The one
girl whom I cared for and trusted has gaily thrown me over the first
moment she hears that I am not going to have as much money as she
thought. I'm losing my temper now, and I'm glad of it. I shall probably
repent every word I say afterwards, but that won't stop me telling you
exactly what I think of you. I don't suppose you've ever been in love at
all&mdash;except to the extent of having signed photographs of Owen Nares and
Henry Ainley stuck all over your bedroom, but when you do, I hope you
get it really badly, you deserve to be absolutely utterly wretched, as
wretched as you've made me, and I hope when you do marry that you get a
rotten old Scotch marmalade maker who says "Hoots!" and spills haggis
all down his waistcoat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>bursting into tears</i>). Oh, Bobbie, how dare you....</p>

<p class="c">(<i>goes to her and goes down on his knees</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Oh, Faith darling, forgive me, I didn't mean a word of it&mdash;I
swear I didn't....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> (<i>they both rise</i>). Whether you meant it or not I hate you.
(<i>Pushes him away.</i>) You're blatant and beastly, and I never wish to see
you again. (<i>She walks upstairs and pauses.</i>) I shall have breakfast in
my room. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>stamps out and collides with</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>, <i>who is coming in with<br />
a bunch of freshly picked flowers.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Why can't you look where you're going?</p>

<p class="c">(<i>He stamps out of sight.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Nice sweet-tempered little fellow. (<i>Moves to above table; puts
roses in bowl. Takes "Daily Mirror" from window-seat, goes down to
Chesterfield and reads it.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>downstairs with bag. He comes very quietly and
doesn't see</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. <i>He stumbles and</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>watches him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). Excuse me! Have you been stealing any thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>putting down bag</i>). Damn! I didn't want any one to see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Where were you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>(<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">R.C.</span>). To the <i>Green Hart</i>. I couldn't face another meal
like dinner last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I know it was pretty awful, but you can't go out of the house
like this. Mother'd be furious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. One more wouldn't matter&mdash;everybody else is. (<i>Coming</i> <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I'm not a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I know, I was just going to except you; you've been charming,
but really it was terrible. I can't stay. Oliver has such a lowering
expression, and if Joyce gives me one more "dumb animal in pain" look, I
shall scream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I can't understand why they're all being so silly&mdash;I gave them
credit for more sense of humour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. And Bobbie&mdash;Bobbie was the worst of the lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Well, one can forgive him a little more because of Faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Why? What about Faith?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>rising, going to him</i>). Oh, the little beast chucked him last
night, the moment she heard you weren't going to leave him a fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Did she, by Jove!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>returning</i> <span class="smcap">R.C.</span>). Personally I'm delighted. I always distrusted
her, and this proves what I've said all along. But that doesn't make
Bobbie any better tempered about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<span class="smcap">L.C.</span>). Poor old Bobbie, I bet he hates me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. If he does he's a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. After all you can't blame him, it's only natural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. He ought to be jolly grateful to you for being the means of
showing her up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Perhaps&mdash;but he won't be. I know what it feels like; we all go
through it sometime or another. I'd love to wring that girl's neck
though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. You like Bobbie best of us all, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. With the exception of you&mdash;yes. I think it's because he's the
most like me. He is, you know. If he'd lived my life he'd have done
exactly the same things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I wonder. (<i>Sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I know. (<i>He sits on chair, head of table.</i>) He's
got just the same regard for the truth, the same sublime contempt of the
world, and the same amount of bombast and good opinion of himself that I
started with, I only hope he'll make better use of his chances, and
carve out a better career for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. If he does, he'll owe it all to you&mdash;first for rousing him up
and making him work, and secondly for getting rid of Faith for him. Had
he married her, she'd have been a millstone round his neck. He doesn't
realize it now, but yesterday was one of the luckiest days of his life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. D'you really think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. I'm sure of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. That's simply splendid. You've bucked me up tremendously. I
shan't mind the <i>Green Hart</i> nearly so much now. (<i>Rising.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>putting him back on seat</i>). Uncle, you're not to go to the
<i>Green Hart</i> at all, I won't have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I must. When they all sit round looking reproachfully at me, it
makes me feel as if I could sink under the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>patting him and kneeling by him</i>). But they won't&mdash;they'll have
got over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. They're all much too young to get over being made fools of as
quickly as that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. But, uncle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. It's no use&mdash;I'm firm. I won't come back until they want me. As
a matter of fact I realise I've been very foolish. I shouldn't have let
things go so far. Naturally they were terribly disappointed at my
wanting to live till eighty-two or eighty-three, and not having any
money to leave them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. They're not really disappointed so much as outraged. They feel
you've been laughing up your sleeve at them, as of course you have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. No, I haven't&mdash;you're wrong there&mdash;I haven't. I couldn't help
you financially. I'd borrowed the money to come over and the cheque I'd
sent before. I'd just won, so I thought that the only way to assist at
all was to use mental persuasion on all of you. There's always something
fascinating in the idea of having money left one. It seems such an easy
way of getting it. Of course it answered better than I could have
imagined in my wildest dreams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. It was a little unnecessary to take each of us aside like you
did and stuff us up with hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. That and a bunch of keys was all I had. It was such a wonderful
situation. I&mdash;never having had a penny in the wide, (<i>gaily</i>), arranging
to leave you my entire fortune. (<i>He starts to laugh.</i>) You must confess
it was very, very funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>also laughing</i>). Yes, it was.... (<i>They both laugh heartily</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>still laughing</i>). And when I said I had sleeping sickness!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>weak with laughter</i>). Oh, uncle, how <i>could you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>wiping his eyes</i>). Oh dear, oh dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Poor mother getting more mystified every minute, and bothered
poor Tibbets till he doesn't know if he is on his head or his heels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rising suddenly</i>). But look here, they'll all be down in a
minute. (<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>stands up.</i>) They mustn't find me here, poised for
flight. I must go at once. (<i>Going behind Chesterfield and picking up
bag.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of him</i>). Yes, but will you promise on your word of honour
to come back the moment I send for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. If you give me <i>your</i> word of honour not to send for me until
everything's quite all right and everyone is perfectly amiable towards
me. I couldn't bear any more rebuffs. I should burst into tears if
anybody even gave me a look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Yes, I'll promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I trust you because, after all, you spotted from the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. That wasn't very difficult. I've always had a good eye for
hypocrites. (<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>slaps her.</i>) Mind you don't go any further afield
than the <i>Green Hart</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. You bet I shan't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Hello, mother. (<i>Kiss across</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>banisters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Good morning, darling. Are there any letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Only one for you, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>taking letter from table</i>). From Tibbets, I expect.
(<i>Sniffs at it.</i>) No! From Isobel Harris. (<i>Sits at the head of the
table.</i>) I do hope she doesn't want to come and stay&mdash;I couldn't bear
that. (<i>Opens it.</i>) Oh no, it's only to say that Fanny's engaged to an
officer in the Coldstream Guards. How splendid for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Poor Fanny&mdash;I'm glad. (<i>Sits in chair on her mother's left.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Why do you say poor Fanny, dear? I'm sure she's very
fortunate. Now-a-days when nice men are so scarce. I was only saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. She didn't say he was a nice man&mdash;only that he was in the
Coldstream Guards. I said poor because I can just imagine all her awful
relations as bridesmaids, and her father and mother shoving her up the
altar steps in their efforts to get her safely married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Isobel means well, although she's a little trying. But
I've never liked Charlie&mdash;no man with such a long, droopy moustache
could ever be really trusted. Besides, they're so insanitary. Sound the
gong again, dear. I do wish they'd all learn to be a little more
punctual.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>does so, and returns to sideboard. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>downstairs

anything. I'll go up presently. Oh, and will you find out if Mr. Davis

Mrs. Harris. I do wish Daniel would come in. Where can he be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. No one cares, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. How can you be so horrid, Bobbie&mdash;I did think you'd have
recovered from your silly temper before this. Fancy not being able to
take a joke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. It wasn't a joke, it was true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. You really are utterly absurd. Pass me the toast. I
wouldn't have believed you could all have been so silly. I expect Uncle
Daniel is just laughing at you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Yes, that's just what he <i>is</i> doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I really think, Oliver, that you, as the eldest, ought to
set a little better example. And the marmalade&mdash;thank you. After all,
considering how good he's been to us, we might allow him to have a
little joke without becoming disagreeable&mdash;even if it doesn't amuse us
very much. Why, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. But, mother, I tell you it isn't a joke&mdash;it's the gospel truth.</p>

this morning. Would that be it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span> (<i>furiously</i>). Look here, Bobbie, if you go leaving my racquet
out all night again I'll punch your head....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Shut up, Joyce, and mind your own business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>. Don't speak to Joyce like that, Bobbie. You ought to be

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. But only in fun, darling, only in fun&mdash;he's obviously a
very rich man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Hah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. By the by, I wish one of you would just go into the garden
and find him. The mushrooms will be ruined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. He isn't in the garden at all, mother, he's gone to the <i>Green
Hart</i>.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>All look surprised.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. What do you mean, Sylvia? Why has he gone to the <i>Green
Hart</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Because every one here had been so beastly to him.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>They all continue breakfast hurriedly.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. You mean that he&mdash;&mdash;! Oh, Sylvia! (<i>She bursts into
tears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Mother darling, don't cry.... (<i>Rises and kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>weeping bitterly</i>). Darling Danny. My only brother. And
you've driven him away&mdash;after all his kindness and everything. Oh, how
could you? How could you? He must be sent for at once. (<i>She rises and
rings the bell, dropping bits of newspaper en route.</i>) You're wicked,
wicked children, and you don't deserve any one to be kind to you ever
again.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p>Oh, Griggs, send the car down to the <i>Green Hart</i> at once to fetch Mr.
Davis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Griggs</span>. Yes, madam.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>). How dare you behave like you have done. I shall
never, never forgive you&mdash;you're cruel and horrid and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. It's all very fine, mother, but he made fools of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. He didn't do anything of the sort&mdash;he only meant it
kindly&mdash;going to all that trouble, too (<i>she weeps again</i>), with one
foot in the grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. And the other in the <i>Green Hart</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. He's not going to die. He said he meant to live to eighty-two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Eighty-three, I think, was the age, dear, but that's just
another instance of his dear unselfishness&mdash;so that you wouldn't worry
over him. I know! I'm going up to my room&mdash;you've upset me for the rest
of the day. Call me the very moment he comes. Oh, how could you? How
could you be so unkind? Oh, just look at my nose, it's all red and
shiny.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit upstairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>follows, standing at the foot of the stairs,
looking after her. There is silence for a moment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. That's torn it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span>. Now what are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>moving down</i>). I know. (<i>At head of table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. What, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Apologise to Uncle Dan, every one of you, for being such utter
beasts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Well, I'm hanged!</p>

<p class="c">(<i>During the following speech, the others continue their breakfasts.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. So you jolly well ought to be. Who do you owe your position in
the motor works to, Oliver? Uncle Dan. Who do you owe your song
successes to, Bobbie? Uncle Dan. And you, Joyce, d'you think you'd have
won a single thing if it hadn't been for him? Do you imagine Evangeline
would have had the vim to have stuck to her novel if it hadn't been for
Uncle Dan's faith in her? I know I should never have done a thing,
either. And all we did it for apparently, was that he could die off
conveniently and leave us his money&mdash;the moment he'd done that I suppose
we should have stopped working. What charming characters! Waiting for a
man to die, and then getting disagreeable because he says he doesn't
want to. Do you think any one of you would stop work now for anything?
Of course you wouldn't. I know <i>that</i>. Don't you see that Uncle Dan
chose the one and only way of really helping us? He's worked wonders and
we ought to be thankful to him until our dying day....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>marmalade on toast in hand</i>). It's all very fine for you&mdash;he
hasn't come between you and the only person you've ever loved....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. And that's one of the best things of all&mdash;he's been the means of
showing Faith up in her true colours. Bobbie, you must realise now in
your heart of hearts what a rotter she is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. She wouldn't have been if it wasn't for her beastly mother. Just
because you found him out before us, by a fluke, you think you can
preach to us about being rude to him. Well, you'd have been just as bad
under the same circumstances, if not worse. The fact of you having
spotted his game doesn't make it any the less disgusting. He's behaved
atrociously and you know it, making fools of us all. What do you think
my friends will say? Joyce's school girls? Vangy's literary nuts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>coming down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>to below Chesterfield</i>). It's your own silly
faults. You shouldn't have told them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> (<i>rising</i>). Don't be so superior. Of course we only did in
confidence. (<i>Going up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Well, that's not Uncle Dan's fault, he only did it for the
best....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>. Best be damned!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. If you can't curb your language I should think you'd better go
outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>rising, knife in hand</i>). I shall do exactly as I like. I'm fed
up with you, Sylvia, you're as bad as he is. (<i>Throws knife on table.</i>)
And if you think you can get round us by making excuses for him you're
jolly well mistaken. I suppose all this is a put-up job! (<i>Moves to</i>
<span class="smcap">L.C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>R.C.</i>). How dare you, Bobbie! It's nothing of the sort. Only
luckily I have a little discrimination, I can see the difference between
good and bad, and Uncle Dan's good, good all through. He wouldn't do
harm to any one or anything in the world. He did all this out of genuine
kindness. He couldn't help us in any other way, so he made us work,
hoping it would improve us. And I should think he'd go back to America
sick and wretched inside with disappointment having discovered that we,
his only relatives, have only liked him and been nice to him because of
his money&mdash;waiting for him to die like beastly treacherous ghouls.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> <i>attempts to speak.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>That's what you are, ghouls! (<i>Turning on</i> <span class="smcap">Evangeline</span>.) And selfish
pigs, and if you don't apologise to him I shall never speak to any of
you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver</span>. Hah! (<i>Throws down serviette and exits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Oh, you're very dignified walking out like that without saying
anything. I hate you! I hate you all! Poor Uncle Daniel&mdash;it's rotten.
(<i>She bursts out crying, and subsides on Chesterfield.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Towards the end of her speech, the rest have risen and walked out with
their heads in the air</i>, <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> <i>kicks violently at paper on floor
and goes upstairs. There is a moment's pause, then enter</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>
<i>from garden.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>). I left the car down the drive, hoping to make a
sweet lovable entrance with perhaps a few rose leaves on my coat. Where
is everybody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>sniffing on Chesterfield</i>). It's no use, they're still being
beastly. Mother sent for you. She's frightfully upset at your going to
the <i>Green Hart</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. If they're keeping it up, I think I'd better go back. (<i>Moving
towards entrance.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>rising</i>). No, you're not to do anything of the sort, you're to
stay here. (<i>Firmly.</i>) They can be as disagreeable as they like, we'll
go about together; you can come to the studio with me to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>up to her</i>). You, Sylvia, are what is described as a
sympathetic character. You've been very nice to me all along. Can I
leave you anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. Don't joke about it, uncle, it's all so horrid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. If I don't joke I shall burst into storms of passionate sobbing.
(<i>Moves down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>. That would be rather awful. Here comes mother....</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>downstairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Danny darling, why were you so silly as to take any notice
of the children? They're unkind and heartless, and I ordered the
mushrooms specially for you this morning. Sit down and have them now.
They'll be quite hot still. (<i>She pushes him into chair.</i>) Sylvia, get
them, if you please. I can't think why they're all behaving like this, I
shall never forgive them, Danny dear. You won't let them upset you, will
you?</p>

<p class="c">(<i>She kisses him.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>sits in</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia's</span> <i>chair</i>, <span class="smcap">Daniel</span><br />
<i>in</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott's</span>.)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Well, they seem to have upset everything else.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Bring some more toast and coffee, Griggs. Or would you
rather have tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Tea, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Tea then, Griggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Griggs</span>. Very good, madam. (<i>Picks up remains of paper above Chesterfield
and exit</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> (<i>handing him plate of mushrooms and bacon</i>). Here you are, uncle
dear&mdash;I'm going upstairs. Call me if you want anything.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span> <i>upstairs.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I'm sure he won't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Now look here, Anne, you're not to include Sylvia in your fury
against the family. She has been perfectly sweet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. So she ought to be&mdash;and the others as well. Such nonsense,
I never heard of such a thing. Not being able to take a joke better than
that. I don't know what's happened to them, they were such dear
good-natured children. They used to make booby traps and apple-pie beds
for one another and not mind a bit.</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> <i>keeps buttering toast for him, arranging it round<br />
his plate.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. But you see, Anne, this perhaps has irritated them more than an
apple-pie bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. I don't see why, it's just as harmless, and much less
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. If I had known they were going to take it so badly I should have
thought of something else. I have lots of ideas. But even now, when I
come to look back over everything, I don't see what else I could have
done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. You're just the kindest old darling in the world and
everything, every single thing you have done for us, has been perfect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>. Dear Anne, don't be absurd. It was nothing, worse than nothing,
but I'd given it a lot of thought, and after all it has bucked them up
and made them work. They're looking much better in health, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>. Oh, Danny, I only wish you were better in health. The
shadow of your illness just hangs over me like a nightmare. I can't pass
a flower shop without thinking of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>puts down knife and fork</i>). But I'm not ill at all. I've no
intention of dying until I'm eighty-three or even eighty-four.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Dear old boy, you're only saying that so that I shan't
worry. (<i>She dabs her eyes.</i>) But it's no use, you can't deceive me, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> But, Anne, I swear.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> There, there, we'll say no more about it. It only upsets
me and here's your tea.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>She takes tea from</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span>, <i>who has entered with tea and toast. He<br />
goes off again.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>Have you seen your doctor lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>resignedly</i>). Yes, I saw him the other day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>pouring out tea</i>). And what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>confused</i>). Well&mdash;er&mdash;I don't know&mdash;he sounded me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Yes, they always do that. I wonder why. Your illness has
nothing to do with your heart has it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>firmly</i>). My dear Anne, I haven't got an illness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I'm sure I hope not, dear, but if he said that, I should
really get another more expert opinion if I were you. A man like that
can't be really reliable. I don't believe in doctors ever since poor
Millicent Jenkins died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Look here, Anne, I really do want to make you understand that
what I told the children is perfectly true. I haven't any money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> Nonsense, dear, you can't pull my leg as easily as that.
How were you able to send that cheque when I most needed it, and those
lovely Christmas presents, and the fares backwards and forwards to
America&mdash;I believe you've got some big surprise for us all later on and
you're afraid that we'll guess it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes, I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<i>rising</i>). Now look here, dear, I must leave you for a
little while. Saturday is the busiest morning in the whole week. Finish
off your breakfast and smoke a pipe&mdash;or a cigar or something; if any of
the children come near you, just ignore them or pretend to be
frightfully angry with them. That will bring them round.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span> <i>hurriedly</i>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Griggs.</span> If you please, madam, the boiler is making the most peculiar
noises. Shall I send for Brown to come and look at it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott.</span> I don't think that will do it any good, but still perhaps
you'd better. I'll come myself in a minute.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Griggs</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>). Really, everything is going wrong this morning, first
you, Danny, then the boiler; sometimes life isn't worth living&mdash;I do
hope it won't burst.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dermott</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>sits thoughtful for a moment and</i>
<i>then resumes his breakfast. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>from garden. She sees</i>
<span class="smcap">Uncle Daniel</span> <i>and comes rather sheepishly up to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Uncle, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>gruffly</i>). Good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>feebly</i>). Good morning. (<i>There is a long pause.</i>) Uncle
Daniel&mdash;we've&mdash;er&mdash;we've all been talking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> That's quite a natural and healthy occupation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> We&mdash;we were talking about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> That makes it none the less natural or healthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> Of course it didn't. You see&mdash;I mean to say&mdash;we&mdash;well, they sent
me in to tell you that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Perhaps you'd better tell me another time when you are more in
the mood. Have you seen the papers anywhere?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce.</span> They ought to be over there. (<i>She points to window seat</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>,
<i>and goes down to</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie's</span> <i>chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>rising and moving quickly to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>). Thanks. Don't you bother&mdash;I
can get my own paper. (<i>Gets newspaper and returns to his seat at the
head of the table.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>There is a long silence</i>, <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>reads the paper.</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>shakes her
head as</i> <span class="smcap">Oliver</span> <i>strolls in from the garden and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>for
news.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> Have you had your breakfast, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes, thank you, and I slept beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> It's a jolly nice morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> That remark makes up in truth for what it lacks in originality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> Oh. (<i>Moves to window</i>, <span class="smcap">L.C.</span>, <i>turns, catches</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel's</span> <i>eye and
turns quickly back.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<span class="smcap">Joyce</span> <i>continues to fidget at the foot of the table. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span>

<i>who shakes her head vigorously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Have you a headache, Joyce, you keep wagging it about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>very politely</i>). No, thank you, uncle, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Splendid, then I shan't have to offer you an aspirin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline</span> and <span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>together, coming forward hand-in-hand down</i>
<span class="smcap">R.C.</span>). Uncle, we've all been&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>They stop.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> Yes?</p>

<p class="c">(<i>There is business of each of them wishing the other to speak to</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.)<br />
</p>

<p>Tell me one thing, if any of you are capable of uttering a word, is this
a game? Have I got to guess whether something's a vegetable or a mineral
or something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> No, uncle, it's a much harder game than that&mdash;for us,
anyhow. We've come to apologise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span> (<i>lowering the paper</i>). Oh, have you? (<i>Turns to them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> Oh, won't you please be nice and make it easier for us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span> You none of you made things in the least easy for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evangeline.</span> I know we didn't, but we're all sorry&mdash;frightfully
sorry&mdash;we've talked it all over. Sylvia said we were beasts and ghouls
and we wouldn't admit it then, but we do now. We are terribly ashamed of
the way we've behaved. Please, please say you forgive us. (<i>Kneels to
him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobbie</span> (<i>placing chair behind Chesterfield</i>). And it doesn't matter
about Faith, uncle, I'm glad you were the means of showing her up. I
don't love her a bit now. I hate her, and we all want you to understand
that we'd rather have you alive and with us than all the beastly money
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joyce</span> (<i>leaning forward over table</i>). And we'll do anything you like to
atone for it. We'll abase ourselves like they used to in the olden days
to show they repented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver.</span> Will you let it go at that, uncle? (<i>He comes forward to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>
<i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel.</span>)</p>
